# OverRoute v1 üôå

**OverRoute** is a DNS-level firewall and route manipulator built to block MDM servers on demand ‚Äî giving the user full control over a locked-down iPad environment.

> "They gave me a profile. I gave them silence."

# READ FIRST!

Before installation, i'd just like to inform you about the risks of this, etc.
- It is possible that you may get caught red handed. **YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS!!**
- This is a very powerful tool.
- Read everything. Im being serious.
- Stay vigilant.

---

## Purpose

This tool is designed to **disable MDM enforcement** by cutting off its connection to its command server, effectively freezing all restrictions and making the device act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äî but free.

OverRoute v1 uses DNS blocking and route spoofing to prevent:

- MDM check-ins
- MDM config pushes
- MDM profile removals from reporting

---

## Features

- Blocks MDM server (`sa.eschoolpad.net/server`)
- Prevents `/checkin/dlsu` beaconing
- No need to remove profile (keeps device "compliant")
- Fast toggle between ON/OFF (once only)
- Zero jailbreak or sideload needed
- Works even on supervised iPads

---

## How It Works

1. MDM tries to call home to `https://sa.eschoolpad.net/server/checkin/dlsu`
2. OverRoute v1 **BLOCKS** the domain entirely.
3. Device **cannot talk** to MDM, freezing it in place
4. Profile is never removed, so **no ‚Äúcheck-out‚Äù alert is triggered**

---

## Usage

> This version assumes you're using an iPad (like the required device, dude.)

### 1. Install DNS

on iPad Safari:
```url
https://bit.ly/overroute
```

Install it ‚Üí blocks MDM routing.

---

## Notes

- MDM will silently **fail to update or apply restrictions**
- If device goes online and connects to the real MDM server, it will **re-apply all policies**
- Profile is still installed, just inert
- This is a passive bypass ‚Äî **no tampering of the profile or OS**

---

##  Coming in OverRoute v2

-  Toggle MDM on/off in Web UI
-  Fake MDM server with Flask
-  Auto-reinstall MDM profiles (signed)
-  Silent ‚Äúanti-checkout‚Äù beacon blocker
-  Logging + Scheduler
